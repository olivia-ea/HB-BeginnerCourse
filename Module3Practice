'''
Setup: Type the following into your repl Python console.
Write an if-statement for each of the above variables. The if-statement should check whether the length of the variable’s value is greater than 9 characters. If it is, your code should print “long string”. If it’s not, print “not a long string”.

Here’s a hint:

Here’s the first part. It accomplishes half of the problem. However, it doesn’t accomplish printing “not a long string” when the length is not greater than 9 characters.
'''

adjective = "absolutely fabulous"
adjective2 = "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"
noun = "aardvarks"
noun2 = "billy goats"
verb = "lollygagging"
verb2 = "jogging"

if len(adjective) > 9:
   print "long string"
else:
  print "not a long string"

if len(adjective2) > 9:
   print "long string"
else:
  print "not a long string"

if len(noun) > 9:
   print "long string"
else:
  print "not a long string"

if len(noun2) > 9:
   print "long string"
else:
  print "not a long string"

if len(verb) > 9:
   print "long string"
else:
  print "not a long string"

if len(verb2) > 9:
   print "long string"
else:
  print "not a long string"

'''
Using the raw_input function, prompt yourself to type something. Be sure to capture what you type into a variable. Once you have the variable, print the length of whatever you typed.
'''

myinput = raw_input("Type a word to find its length: ")

len_myinput = len(myinput)

print(myinput, len_myinput)

'''
Type the following into the repl Python console:
Then, write some code that follows these specifications:

If the user is correct, tell them they are correct.
If the user is incorrect, tell them whether their answer is too high or too low.
Do this a couple of times, making sure that if you type 1) the wrong answer 2) a “too high” answer and 3) a “too low” answer all show the correct output.
'''

correct = (2 + 2)
correct_as_integer = int(correct)

answer = raw_input("What is 2 + 2 ?")
answer_as_integer = int(answer)

if answer_as_integer != correct_as_integer:
  print("You are incorrect!")
  if answer_as_integer > correct_as_integer:
    print("Your answer is too high.")
  else:
    print("Your answer is too low.") 
else:
  print("You are correct!")

'''
Write a conditional statement that checks if the variables verb and verb2 are equal to one another. If they are, print “They are equal!”. If they aren’t, print 3 things: the value of verb, the value of verb2, and the message “These are not the same”
'''

if verb == verb2:
  print("They are equal!")
else:
  print("They are not equal.", verb, "is not equal to", verb2, "These are not the same.")

'''
Type the following code to prompt the user to rate the movie Wizard of Oz:
Then, write an if/elif/else statement that follows these specifications:

If they rate less than 5, tell the user “Wow, you hated it!”
If they rate less than 7, tell the user “You are meh about this movie.”
If they rate more than 7, tell the user “You loved it. There’s no place like home.”
'''

rating = raw_input("On a 1-10 scale, how would you rate Wizard of Oz?")
rating_as_integer = int(rating)

if rating_as_integer < 5:
  print ("Wow, you hated it!")
elif rating_as_integer < 7:
  print ("You are meh about this movie.")
else:
  print ("You loved it. There's no place like home.")
  
 '''
 OUTPUT:
 
 long string
long string
not a long string
long string
long string
not a long string
Type a word to find its length:  hellogoodbye
('hellogoodbye', 12)
What is 2 + 2 ? 9
You are incorrect!
Your answer is too high.
('They are not equal.', 'lollygagging', 'is not equal to', 'jogging', 'These are not the same.')
On a 1-10 scale, how would you rate Wizard of Oz? 8
You loved it. There's no place like home.
