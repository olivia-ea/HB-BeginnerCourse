Part 1

Ask the user as series of questions using raw_input, capturing their input into appropriately-named variables. The questions should be

Where would you like to travel to? Name one place.
What is another place you’d like to travel to? Name one place.
What is one more place you’d like to travel to? Name one place.
Add each piece of user input to an empty list that you create. Please make sure to give the list an appropriate name.

Sort the list of places.

Then, tell the user where they said they’d like to go. Show each place on a separate line.

Part 2

Copy the following list into your file:
fun_words = ["elephant", "balloon", "macchiato", "angostura"]

Then, make a two empty lists– one called first_letters and one called third letters.

Using list_indexing along with string_indexing, make a variable for the first letter of each word in the fun_words list.

Need a hint?

Part 3

Copy the following 3 lists into your file:

websites = ["facebook", "twitter", "buzzfeed"]
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "mango", "berry"]
names = ["Bob", "Alice", "Henry", "Rick", "Carl"]

Find the length of each of these lists, and store this value in three separate variables.

Make an empty list called lengths.

Add each length to the lengths lists.

Part 4

Make a list of 25 numbers. Do not hard-code the numbers– that is, don’t type out 25 numbers yourself. Review the lesson if you’re not sure how to make a list of numbers using Python.

Once you have your list of 25 numbers, print out the first, fifth, tenth, and fifteenth item in your list.
